# alexa-skills-shopping-cart
It is a simple alexa skill spike project in Java, which I have been working on.
The main goal is decoupling it into a easily configurable project, that allows you to build quickly alexa skill in Java.

**Note:**
- The current version is a spike, so it is **not done yet in TDD**
- Shopping car is just an example
